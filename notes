Biomass Allocation among Reproductive Structures in the Dioecious Shrub Oemleria Cerasiformis -- A Functional Interpretation
J. Antos and G. Allen, 1994, Journal of Ecology Vol. 82 pp. 21-29

Best take-aways:
- Pollinator-attracting structures in males were heavier than females (larger biomass), however females had larger total flower biomass
- Pollen limitation is the primary factor influencing the evolution of reproductive allocation in males
- The flowers of both sexes produce nectar and attract generalist pollinators, such as beetles, thrips and honeybees. Geometrid moths have been observed pollinating in Oregon
- 20 plants for each sex, 25 inflorescences from each of the 40 plants
- Pollinator attraction comprises at least 15% of reproductive biomass  (petals), and if the hypanthium is assigned mostly to  pollinator attraction, this function may comprise over  60% of reproductive biomass.

Other, longer points:
- Floral differences between the sexes are constrained by (1) the phylogenetic relationships of 0.  cerasiformis to its hermaphrodite ancestors, and (2) the necessity of attracting the same pollinators to  male and female plants. The fact that floral differences have evolved thus supports the conclusion that  pollinator attraction has been a more important selection pressure in males than females.
- relative allocation to pollinator attraction  in females decreases rapidly with increasing fruit set
- "Bet hedging": Consistently low fruit set suggests that flowers  have functions additional to fruit production. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain the  existence of 'excess' flowers, including bet hedging  and pollinator attraction (Bawa & Webb 1984;  Sutherland 1986a; Ehrlen 1991).
- A chronic insufficiency of  pollinators could result in selection for 'extra' flowers that have the primary function of pollinator attraction, and seldom yield fruit even under the most  favourable environmental condition
- It is difficult to  account for large allocations to petals and other  attractive structures except in terms of past pollinator  limitation


Relative reproductive effort in males and females of the dioecious shrub Oemleria cerasiformis
J. Antos and G. Allen, 1988, Oecologia, 1988, Vol. 76 pp. 111-118
- females had 4.1x greater reproductive effort than males [because of fruit mass?]
- males produce approximately three times as many flowers per unit of leaf biomass as females

Flowering pattern and fruit production in the dioecious shrub Oemleria cerasiformis 
Geraldine Allen, 1986, Canadian Journal of Botany, Vol. 64 pp. 1216-1220

Background on Oemleria:
- In O. cerasiformis the correlation between fruit set and inflorescence size suggests that pollinators may find larger inflorescences more attractive.
- Male inflorescences begin sooner than females but reach their peak and finish flowering later
- Most common at low elevations and on alluvial soils
- Peak flowering is between early February and late March
- Abrams (1944) and Munz (1959) describe Oernleria as polygamodioecious, functionally cosexual individuals appear to be rare to nonexistent
- plants are apparently insect-pollinated, but little is known about their pollinators.
- on southern Vancouver Island, where 0 . cerasifortnis is a common understory species in mixed forests of Pseudotsuga rnenziesii and Quercus garqlatza
- Male inflorescences lasted an average of 8 days longer than female inflorescences in 1984, and 4 days longer in 1984
- the differences in duration of inflorescence did not appear to be related to flower number
- male inflorescences last longer than female inflorescencesbecause the males open their flowers at less frequent intervals

Background on dioeciousness in general:
-differences in the selective pressures on each sex (the cost of producing fruit in females for instance) are likely to lead to divergent reproductive strategies
- males may compete among themselves for access to females
- males of many dioecious plants produce larger numbers of flowers and remain longer in flower ihan the females (Lloyd and Webb 1977; Barrett and Helenunn 1981; Bawa et al. 1982; Bullock et al. 1983). Such a pattern could result from competition among male plants (and among pollen grains) for access to ovules (Stephenson and Bertin 1983).

Useful for future:
- observed at 3- to 4-day intervals between February 14 and March 30, and the numbers of flowers in bud, open, and senescent on the tagged inflorescences were recorded
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test: flowering curves for males and females significantly different
- Mann-Whitney U-test: number of inflorescences per stem significantly larger in males than in females
- F-test for homogeneity of variance: Males were significantly more variable than females in both duration of inflorescence and time of peak flowering during 198
- peak flowering times in both sexes were 23 days earlier in 1984 than in 1985


Oemleria cerasiformis overview by Dr. William Stein, USDA Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, Oregon
- Osoberry range is on the Pacific Coast eastward into the Cascade Mountains, from southwest British Columbia to California.
- Antos and Allen 1990b concluded it needs 1) fairly mild maritime climate 2) air-moist areas 3) not low light levels or wet soils 4) some ground disturbance to allow seedling establishment
- most widely distributed from Willamette Valley to Vancouver Island, especially in Garry Oak savannah and open Douglas fir forests

- "Osoberry’s native range is from the Pacific Coast eastward into the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada from southwest British Columbia southward to California, extending to Tulare County in the Sierras and northern Santa Barbara County in the coastal ranges (Hitchcock and others 1961; McMinn 1970)."
- "most widely distributed from the Willamette Valley northward to Vancouver Island on stream terraces, alluvial soils, and other moist to moderately dry locations, especially in Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana Dougl. ex Hook.) woodlands and open Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forests."
- "Antos and Allen (1990b) concluded that its geographical distribution is related to (1) a fairly mild maritime climate, (2) moist areas over much of its range, (3) an inability to tolerate low light levels or wet soils, and (4) a need for disturbance to allow seedling establishment."
- Two varieties were described in 1905—lancifolia in British Columbia and nigra in Washington (Hitchcock and others 1961


Habitat Relationships of the Pacific Coast Shrub Oemleria Cerasiformis (rosaceae)
Joseph A. Antos and Geraldine A. Allen, 1990, Madrono (California Botanical Society), Vol. 37  pp. 249-260

Background on Oemleria:
- Phytogeographic patterns are important variables among stands across PNW
- Common only in the narrow segment of regional moisture gradient that spans the transition from Quercus garryana (dry) to Pseudotsuga menziesii forests and Alnus rubra streamside groves.
- Oelmeria is distinct from other prunus in that it is dioecious and has multiple pistils per flower
- We have found no niche differences between sexes (Allen and Antos unpublished) !!!!

Core of this paper:
- we determined the species composition of stands containing Oemleria throughout much of its range
- Herbaceous plants were excluded because we sampled when Oemleria was in bloom, prior to the emergence of many herbaceous species
- Although moisture generally increases to the north in the study area, the stands did not separate out in a simple north-south pattern. Dry site species such as Q. Garryana and S. Albus were common in stands from Willamette Valley and V.I. In contrast, the wetter-site species, Picea sitchensis and Rufus spectabilis occurred primarily in the Washington and California stands, which are directly exposed to storms from the Pacific.
- The non-forest stands, most of which were in early stages of succession to forest, were located on the ordination primarily between the dry Quercus stands and the wetter stands containing conifers, Acer macrophyllum or Alnus rubra.
- The second ordination axis reflected phytogeographical patterns, Acer circinatum and Fraxinus latifolia occur in the Willamette valley and Washington stands but are absent from the other stands, may explain why both the north and south ends of the study area occurred at the top of the ordination
- In order to reveal underlying patterns that might be obscured by the strong phytogeographical gradient in the overall data set, we examined different geographic areas separately.
- Oemleria is most abundant the extreme southeast end of the island, which is the driest part... but is uncommon elsewhere on the island.
- The Quercus stands clustered on the right side of the ordination, they generally had deep soils, often with a high cover of Oemleria and Symphoricarpus Albus
- Driest Quercus stands in the area, which occurred on shallow soils over bedrock, supported few or no Oemleria. The Quercus forests grade into moderately dry coniferous forest dominated by Pseudotsuga menziesii. Oemleria is often the most common tall shrub species in these forests.
- Most forests on Vancouver Island are wetter than those containing Oemleria and would extend along the moisture gradient off to the left side of the ordination.

- Lack of moisture is unlikely to be the reason for the absence of Oemleria from Wet, upland coniferous forests [me: like Tsuga heterophylla forest]. The plants are probably unable to survive in the low light environment under dense coniferous canopies. Although hOemleria is moderately shade tolerant and grows well under Quercus garryana and in open stands of Pseudotsuga menziesii, we frequently observed plants dying back (apparently from lack of light) when overtopped by Abies grandis or Thuja plicate. 
- It is also possible that the soils of wet, upland coniferous forests are unfavourable for Oemleria ,which normally grows on relatively rich alluvial soils or on soils that developed under hardwood forests or savanna. Many of the Pseudotsuga forests in which Oemleria grows have developed from Quercus woodlands in historic times, as a result of fire suppression.
- These areas previously supported by fire-maintained Quercus savanna or woodland ,which has now become Quercus or Pseudotsuga forest.
- First year seedlings can be abundant in forests but seem to rarely survive long except in openings. Even-aged populations are uncommon and Oemleria does not appear to invade open sites rapidly. Young plants usually occur beneath old plants.
- Oemleria can be very long lived. The plants frequently die back when conditions are adverse but often resprout from the base, which may allow them to persist longer under low light conditions, observed for Prunus serotina
- Fire suppression, which may have led to density increases in Oemleria populations, also results in succession to coniferous forests, which has probably eliminated populations on some sites.
- If the same processes restricted Oemleria in wet coniferous forests [low sunlight] also operate in the drier coniferous forests [Pseudotsuga take-over from lack of fire suppression]... the species may decrease in abundance on upland sites.


Modules of reproduction in females of the dioecious shrub Oemleria cerasiformis
Matthew G. E. Mitchell, Joseph A. Antos, Geraldine A. Allen, 2004. Canadian Journal of Botany Vol. 82 Issue 3 pp. 394-400




Ideas:
- iNat observations of Osoberry, then distance to a Garry oak observation or Pseudotsuga observation, then when the date of a flowering observation is.
Prediction: Osoberry associated with Q. Garryana bloom later due to decreased water availability 
Osoberry in wet forests may be smaller due to decreased light exposure

 Notes, to-do:
 R script that gets obs, gets coords, makes map.
 Each iNat observation should be well documented. This makes data collection methods obvious and easy.
 
 Osoberry is of interest, dioecious
 Thank: Martin for telling me Osoberry smells like cat urine
 
 G. Allen for teaching me evolution during COVID, and then showing up on the Wikipedia for Osoberry
 - Map where male and females are
 - 10min. observation periods preferably in peak daylight hours, relative pollination activity (visible pollinators
 - Male-biased sex ratio in this species ()
 - Males produce more reproductive biomass than females (G allen 1988)... is the different scent to not 'cover up' the female?
 - Would more biomass mean a 'stronger' scent? Would the male be more prefential to visit?
 - Differential mortality across different environments --> MODEL!!! What happens if one sex dies more readily than the other?
 Fluctuating light levels
 - High light levels: increased reproductive effort, females increased more than males
 - Low light levels: decreased reproductive effort, females decreased more than males
 - Increased reproductive effort increases chances of mating
 ... would this result in a biased sex-ratio?
 ... would preferential visitation/pollinator-specific interactions rescue from this sex-bias ratio?
 
 How would pollinator-specific interactions work?
 - Increased reproductive biomass means they visit males more than females
 Think of it maybe like this: females are weak but at peak are fruiting/flowering more. Males are resilient and produce more biomass and are visited more by pollinators..
 
 Questions:
 - How long has this sex ratio difference been around?
 - How is it maintained?
 - Could males and females attract different pollinators?
 - Could males attract more pollinators from increased sex-ratio mass?
 
 Osoberry blooming period: Feb to April
 
 iNat data:
 - Annotate all Osoberry in BC for flowering or male/female
 - Plot blooming time overall and then blooming time for males and females
