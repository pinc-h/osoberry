Files for monitoring Mt. Tolmie flower phenology and pollinator visitation  
April 2025, Alex Pinch

Notes, to-do:
R script that gets obs, gets coords, makes map.
Each iNat observation should be well documented. This makes data collection methods obvious and easy.

Osoberry is of interest, dioecious
Thank: Martin for telling me Osoberry smells like cat urine

G. Allen for teaching me evolution during COVID, and then showing up on the Wikipedia for Osoberry
- Map where male and females are
- 10min. observation periods preferably in peak daylight hours, relative pollination activity (visible pollinators
- Male-biased sex ratio in this species ()
- Males produce more reproductive biomass than females (G allen 1988)... is the different scent to not 'cover up' the female?
- Would more biomass mean a 'stronger' scent? Would the male be more prefential to visit?
- Differential mortality across different environments --> MODEL!!! What happens if one sex dies more readily than the other?
Fluctuating light levels
- High light levels: increased reproductive effort, females increased more than males
- Low light levels: decreased reproductive effort, females decreased more than males
- Increased reproductive effort increases chances of mating
... would this result in a biased sex-ratio?
... would preferential visitation/pollinator-specific interactions rescue from this sex-bias ratio?

How would pollinator-specific interactions work?
- Increased reproductive biomass means they visit males more than females
Think of it maybe like this: females are weak but at peak are fruiting/flowering more. Males are resilient and produce more biomass and are visited more by pollinators..

Questions:
- How long has this sex ratio difference been around?
- How is it maintained?
- Could males and females attract different pollinators?
- Could males attract more pollinators from increased sex-ratio mass?

Osoberry blooming period: Feb to April

iNat data:
- Annotate all Osoberry in BC for flowering or male/female
- Plot blooming time overall and then blooming time for males and females
