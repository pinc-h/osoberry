Biomass Allocation among Reproductive Structures in the Dioecious Shrub Oemleria Cerasiformis -- A Functional Interpretation
J. Antos and G. Allen, 1994, Journal of Ecology Vol. 82 pp. 21-29

Best take-aways:
- Pollinator-attracting structures in males were heavier than females (larger biomass), however females had larger total flower biomass
- Pollen limitation is the primary factor influencing the evolution of reproductive allocation in males
- The flowers of both sexes produce nectar and attract generalist pollinators, such as beetles, thrips and honeybees. Geometrid moths have been observed pollinating in Oregon
- 20 plants for each sex, 25 inflorescences from each of the 40 plants
- Pollinator attraction comprises at least 15% of reproductive biomass  (petals), and if the hypanthium is assigned mostly to  pollinator attraction, this function may comprise over  60% of reproductive biomass.

Other, longer points:
- Floral differences between the sexes are constrained by (1) the phylogenetic relationships of 0.  cerasiformis to its hermaphrodite ancestors, and (2) the necessity of attracting the same pollinators to  male and female plants. The fact that floral differences have evolved thus supports the conclusion that  pollinator attraction has been a more important selection pressure in males than females.
- relative allocation to pollinator attraction  in females decreases rapidly with increasing fruit set

"Bet hedging":
Consistently low fruit set suggests that flowers  have functions additional to fruit production. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain the  existence of 'excess' flowers, including bet hedging  and pollinator attraction (Bawa & Webb 1984;  Sutherland 1986a; Ehrlen 1991).
- A chronic insufficiency of  pollinators could result in selection for 'extra' flowers that have the primary function of pollinator attraction, and seldom yield fruit even under the most  favourable environmental condition

- It is difficult to  account for large allocations to petals and other  attractive structures except in terms of past pollinator  limitation


Allen and Antos 1988 Reproductive effort
- females had 4.1x greater reproductive effort than males [because of fruit mass?]
- males produce approximately three times as many flowers per unit of leaf biomass as females


Oemleria cerasiformis overview by Dr. William Stein, USDA Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, Oregon
- Osoberry range is on the Pacific Coast eastward into the Cascade Mountains, from southwest British Columbia to California.
- Antos and Allen 1990b concluded it needs 1) fairly mild maritime climate 2) air-moist areas 3) not low light levels or wet soils 4) some ground disturbance to allow seedling establishment
- most widely distributed from Willamette Valley to Vancouver Island, especially in Garry Oak savannah and open Douglas fir forests



- "Osoberry’s native range is from the Pacific Coast eastward into the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada from southwest British Columbia southward to California, extending to Tulare County in the Sierras and northern Santa Barbara County in the coastal ranges (Hitchcock and others 1961; McMinn 1970)."
- "most widely distributed from the Willamette Valley northward to Vancouver Island on stream terraces, alluvial soils, and other moist to moderately dry locations, especially in Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana Dougl. ex Hook.) woodlands and open Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forests."
- "Antos and Allen (1990b) concluded that its geographical distribution is related to (1) a fairly mild maritime climate, (2) moist areas over much of its range, (3) an inability to tolerate low light levels or wet soils, and (4) a need for disturbance to allow seedling establishment."
- Two varieties were described in 1905—lancifolia in British Columbia and nigra in Washington (Hitchcock and others 1961

 Notes, to-do:
 R script that gets obs, gets coords, makes map.
 Each iNat observation should be well documented. This makes data collection methods obvious and easy.
 
 Osoberry is of interest, dioecious
 Thank: Martin for telling me Osoberry smells like cat urine
 
 G. Allen for teaching me evolution during COVID, and then showing up on the Wikipedia for Osoberry
 - Map where male and females are
 - 10min. observation periods preferably in peak daylight hours, relative pollination activity (visible pollinators
 - Male-biased sex ratio in this species ()
 - Males produce more reproductive biomass than females (G allen 1988)... is the different scent to not 'cover up' the female?
 - Would more biomass mean a 'stronger' scent? Would the male be more prefential to visit?
 - Differential mortality across different environments --> MODEL!!! What happens if one sex dies more readily than the other?
 Fluctuating light levels
 - High light levels: increased reproductive effort, females increased more than males
 - Low light levels: decreased reproductive effort, females decreased more than males
 - Increased reproductive effort increases chances of mating
 ... would this result in a biased sex-ratio?
 ... would preferential visitation/pollinator-specific interactions rescue from this sex-bias ratio?
 
 How would pollinator-specific interactions work?
 - Increased reproductive biomass means they visit males more than females
 Think of it maybe like this: females are weak but at peak are fruiting/flowering more. Males are resilient and produce more biomass and are visited more by pollinators..
 
 Questions:
 - How long has this sex ratio difference been around?
 - How is it maintained?
 - Could males and females attract different pollinators?
 - Could males attract more pollinators from increased sex-ratio mass?
 
 Osoberry blooming period: Feb to April
 
 iNat data:
 - Annotate all Osoberry in BC for flowering or male/female
 - Plot blooming time overall and then blooming time for males and females
